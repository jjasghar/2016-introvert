                <p>
                  These are my tactics, this is how I've learned over the last 2 years of conferances around the world to coupe and get the most out of it

                  These may work for you, but you need to find it in yourself to make conferences enjoyable, no one likes a crabby-conferance goer.

                <p>
                  Your first technology conference is always the hardest. It gets easier, less awkward, and so so much more enjoyable.

                <h2>Tactics</h2>
                <p>
                  Carry around a game or two in your bag.
                  For example: Coup, Resistance, Exploding Kittens are easy and perfectly sized.

                  You'll start seeing the same people year in year out, not harm is saying "Hey didn't I see you last year?"

                  If you identify as an introvert, it's not an excuse not to enjoy tech conferences. You just need to figure out how to make yourself comfortable.

                  There's a huge chance I put this talk together so people would come up to me, instead of me having to make the first move.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Thank you, and any chance anyone wants to play a game?
